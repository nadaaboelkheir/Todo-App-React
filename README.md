# Todo App

A simple Todo application built with React that demonstrates state management using React Hooks and Context API, drag-and-drop functionality for changing the status of todos, and uses Material-UI for styling. The app also utilizes local storage to persist todos between sessions.

## Features

- Add, delete, and edit todos.
- Change the status of todos using drag-and-drop and Manually.
- Filter todos based on their status (e.g., completed, in-progress).
- Persist todos in local storage to maintain state across page reloads.

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: Provides state and lifecycle management in functional components.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
